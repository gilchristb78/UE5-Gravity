# UE5-Gravity
In this repository I will recreate different gravity physics in UE5


### Todo:

 - [ ] Fix Rotating when Gravity Swaps
   - [ ] Currently just goes "down" a bit to avoid ground
   - [ ] should go down the by its height (collision capsule)
   - [ ] better it should slowly rotate towards the correct up vector
 - [ ] Add collision capsule to character not just blueprint
 - [ ] Gravity Point
   - [ ] Sphere collision
   - [ ] mesh in middle
   - [ ] boolean to point towads (planet)
   - [ ] or away (run inside planet)
 - [ ] Character Movement
   - [ ] Accelleration
   - [ ] Cant run into stuff
